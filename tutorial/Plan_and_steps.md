# LambdaRankingFramework

This project aims to make an in-depth study of the lambda-ranking-framework, such as lambdaRank and lambdaMART.

The detailed steps are planned as follows:

#### Step-1: Prepare an in-depth summary about the theoritical details about lambdaRank and lambdaMART.

Requirements:
- Using markdown language, a clear description of the meaning of equations

- Finally, it will be published as a blog post.

Reference links:


#### Step-2: Confirm the implementation details of lambdaMART within LightGBM.
Requirements:
- Make detailed notes of the source code;

- A deep understanding of the implementaiton logic of LightGBM

#### Step-3: Customize ranking objective functions based on LightGBM
- Propose new loss functions;

- Make a uniform comparison of different learning-to-rank methods based on LightGBM (i.e., gradient boosting decision trees).
